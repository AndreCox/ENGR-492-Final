This project was written in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. To run the code, please follow these instructions:

1. **Install Python**: Install Python I used version 3.14.0 [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**: The code requires the following Python libraries:

   - NumPy (used for numerical computations)
   - Matplotlib (used for plotting graphs)
   - Pandas (used for making tables)

     You can install these libraries using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the `final-exam.ipynb` file is located
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open a new tab in your web browser. Click on the `final-exam.ipynb` file to open the notebook.
5. **Execute the cells**: You can run each cell in the notebook by selecting it and clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or by pressing `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard.
